            Hello!
          </h3>
          <p>
            My name is Kaining Zhang, and I am a high school junior from Minnesota. I really enjoy STEM topics, especially computer science and math. I'm currently taking an Intermediate Python course, and I enjoy programming as a hobby as well---I'm very interested in creating applications involving math and games. Even so, I hope to widen my scope of project design and code all sorts of programs that can contribute to the future of programming.
